ShuttleX
Our app will consist of three components:

Autopayment: Passengers scans fingerprint upon boarding the shuttle. The system checks the fingerprint in the VIT database and deducts the amount from the VTOP wallet.

Realtime passenger monitoring using facial-recognition: Results are compared with the no. of fingerprints. The system also tracks passenger exits, updating the count accordingly.

Shuttle location tracking: We'll use Google's API to obtain realtime GPS location of the shuttle.
